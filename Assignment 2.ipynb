    "Answer to question 1 – Commenting any code in python is very simple and easy. On how to comment a code, it depends on the type of code. Normally there are three types of comment as described below.\n",
    "a.\tSingle-line comment – It is used to comment a single line code. It can be a python code or normal description of any code in a single line. Single line codes are placed using a # sign at the beginning of the code and it can also be places using the ctrl + “/” button as shortcut.\n",
    "b.\tMultiline comment – Multi-line comments are usually used when the comments are generally long and goes to multi lines. These are placed using three apostrophe’s (“”” “””)  at the beginning and at the end.\n",
    "c.\tDoc-strings – Docstrings are used while defining a function. These are placed right after the function name to describe a function and can be placed just like multi-line comment.\n"
